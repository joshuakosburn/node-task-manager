# Task Manager
This is a simple task manager built on NodeJS using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The backend was built following a tutorial by John Smilga. John Smilga developed the frontend. You can find his tutorials and resources here: <a href="https://www.johnsmilga.com/" target="_blank">John's Website</a>

This project was a simple refresher of how to develop RESTful APIs.
